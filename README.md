## Code

### Dependencies

Code has been developed with `Python 3.5`. It should work with other versions of `Python 3`, but has not been tested. Moreover, we rely on several third-party libraries, listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). They can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Usage
