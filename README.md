# Generative variational timbre spaces

This repository hosts code and additional results for the paper "Universal audio synthesizer control with normalizing flows".

For a better viewing experience, please **visit the corresponding [supporting website]**.

It directly embeds the following:
  * Supplementary figures
  * Animations of descriptor space traversal (topology)
  * Audio examples of synthesized paths in the space
  * Further detailed space for perceptual inference
  * Additional data and experiments
  
You can also directly parse through the different sub-directories of the main [`docs`](docs) directory.


## Code

### Dependencies

Code has been developed with `Python 3.5`. It should work with other versions of `Python 3`, but has not been tested. Moreover, we rely on several third-party libraries, listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). They can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. (TODO)
